# Right To Work Policy
## Course: Computational Thinking for Governance Analytics

# Purpose of Analysis
Our analysis aims to contribute to this discussion of Right to Work. We aim to consider the relationship between Right to Work laws and outcomes for workforce in terms of income.

# Policy Analysis
Right to Work (RTW) refers to state laws that prohibit unions from compelling individuals to join, or pay union dues as condition for employment.. In addition, Right to Work laws often prohibit contracts that mandate only hiring a unionized workforce.

Although Right to Work laws may seem beneficial to some, critics argue that they are inherently “anti-union.” Due to the existence of federal laws that prevent mandatory union membership, and some argue that Right to Work laws harm unions’ bargaining strength, subsequently lowering salaries and benefits for vulnerable workers.
